                        <div class="question transition"><p>Does Chop Dawg have its own NDA (non-disclosure agreements) that I can sign before I share my idea?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>We do! You’re able to download and sign our NDA <a href="https://chopdawg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Mutual-Nondisclosure-Agreement-ChopDawg.pdf"><b>by clicking here</b></a>, or you can email us directly at <a href="mailto:Hello@ChopDawg.com"><b>Hello@ChopDawg.com</b></a> and have us manually send you a copy.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>Where should I be located to work with Chop Dawg?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>You can be anywhere, as long as you have an internet connection that can handle communication applications such as Google Meet (<em>formally Google Hangouts</em>), Skype, and UberConference. Our clients are working on their businesses from many parts of the world!</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>Do you work with clients in countries outside of the United States?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Absolutely we do! We have worked with clients from many countries such as Canada, Mexico, Ireland, United Kingdom, France, Thailand, Kuwait, Egypt, New Zealand, Australia, and China since 2009.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>What kind of clients has Chop Dawg worked with in the past?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>We’ve built our processes and capabilities to work for a broad range of organization sizes — from early-stage startups to large enterprises. Working in a diversity of spaces is essential to our team’s continuous proficiency and growth.</p>
        <p>We are selective with the industries we work with, but we never turn down an incredible opportunity just because we haven’t worked with a specific industry before. We are continually leveraging our acquired capabilities from past projects into new ones. We discuss this further in our <a href="http://chopdawg.com/process/"><b>Process Page</b></a></p>
        <p>That being said, what are some of the industries that we know very well? Here’s a shortlist: Healthcare, investing, online retail, dating, real estate, the stock market, internal business operations, gaming, theme parks, casinos, education, sports, government, hospitality, and environmental management.</p>
        <p>Use our <a href="http://chopdawg.com/portfolio/"><b>Portfolio Page</b></a> to look through our select catalog of work.</p>
        <p>Don’t see your industry above? Want to see if our team could work in your industry?

We would be happy to help!</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>What it’s like to work with Chop Dawg?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Though every client project is different, we often break our projects into distinct phases that you can read about in our <a href="http://chopdawg.com/process/"><b>Process Page</b></a>.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>Does Chop Dawg charge me to receive a proposal? </p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Our project proposal is always free! That being said, we require any potential client of ours to sign an LOI (<em>Letter of Intent</em>) first before we proceed forward on a proposal. Our proposals do expire 28-days (<em>four full weeks</em>) from the initial date you received it.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>What happens if my proposal expires?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>If your proposal expires after the 28-day expiration, you won’t be able to re-open it for one calendar year. This allows us at Chop Dawg to ensure we’re creating proposals for those who are serious about proceeding forward with us and give other organizations the opportunity to work with us without worrying about a potential conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>Until you sign a Letter of Intent (<em>LOI</em>) with us, there is no time on the clock or expiration date to worry about. We recommend moving forward with a proposal only if you’re determined to begin working with us within 1-2 months from that specific date to avoid having it expire on you prematurely.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>What is a Letter of Intent (LOI)?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Before we begin working on a formal proposal for you, we kindly ask all of our clients to sign and execute a Letter of Intent (<em>LOI</em>) with us. This is a small agreement that discusses everything you should expect in the proposal planning process (<em>Discovery</em>) with us. For example, all of our proposals have a 28-day expiration. If you do not move forward with us after 28-days, you either can let the proposal expire, sign the contract agreement to proceed forward on your project with us, or put down a small 20% refundable deposit to keep the proposal up indefinitely without worrying about it expire.</p>
        <p>Our LOIs also works to avoid any possible conflicts of interest. The LOI allows both us, a fair, transparent way to plan accordingly before working together. Carefully setting the agreed upon terms before anything is underway has allowed for many smooth project turnarounds.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>How does Chop Dawg communicate with clients? How do I communicate with Chop Dawg?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Strong communication makes working together significantly easier, and we take this seriously. That is why for all of our clients, we work together to determine how much communication is needed. Some projects require weekly meetings. For others, bi-weekly and monthly meetings suffice. We are always a call or an email away.  And most of all, we feel accountable for your product’s success. We incorporate you into our process and work with you directly to drive things forward.</p>
        <p>When it comes to our remote meetings, we traditionally use UberConference. This allows you to chat with us, screenshare, and more. UberConference is supported on any web browser, operating system, and even available as a mobile app for both the iPhone and Android. We also have a call-in number that you can use, in case you ever find yourself on the road without a reliable internet connection!</p>
        <p>Outside of our weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly calls with you, you’ll know the personal emails of all of the people on your team. You’ll be able to text message us, call us or email us at any time, and you’ll always hear back from us within one business day, tops. We’re your team and available 24/7 for you.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>How do we collaborate in the Design phase?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>You’ll have access to provide us feedback on everything through two popular tools called Google Drive and InVision. This allows for you to not only track our work in real-time but provide us your feedback in real-time as well.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>How do we collaborate in the Programming phase?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>We build everything on our own, highly secure and private development server. You’ll have direct access to monitor our progress, provide us feedback, and more. When we are building an iOS or Android application, you will receive “<em>builds</em>” to see your app in real-time as we are working on it. If we’re building a web app or website, you will receive a direct URL (<em>link</em>) to access on any web browser.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>How much time will I need to communicate with the Chop Dawg team?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>The more information that we have on what you are looking for, the better! However, we’re also mindful of your time. For many of our clients, hopping onto our weekly, bi-weekly, and/or monthly scheduled calls is more than enough for us to do our jobs successfully. On average, these calls will last between twenty minutes to an hour. In most cases, you will never need to give us more than an hour a week, even on the most complex of projects, though you are always encouraged to provide us more time if you are up to it!</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>Does Chop Dawg provide any delivery guarantees for all projects?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Of course! For any project that we take on, we include an 90-day bug warranty and a 45-day maintenance window. You’ll never owe us final payment on any project until it has been completed 100% and is approved by you.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>Does Chop Dawg work with competing businesses at the same time?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Never. All of our clients sign a non-conflict of interest clause with us in our Letter of Intents (<em>LOIs</em>). For any client that is currently active with us, we will not work with their competitors. It’s our commitment to seeing our clients succeed, always.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>What does being an “active client” mean?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Being an “<em>active clien</em>t” means you have an open, existing contract with Chop Dawg that has yet to be fulfilled/completed.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>Does Chop Dawg own the intellectual property of the project upon completion?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>No, absolutely not. Upon final payment being made, transfer of all ownership for everything we created for that particular project becomes the property of our clients.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>Does Chop Dawg help with the marketing of a project upon completion?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Yes! When we’re creating your product, we always have branding in mind. As a result, we’ll leverage our brand, website traffic, and social media following to promote your product leading up to its launch. In addition, for all of our active clients, we offer a marketing consultation at no additional cost.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>Does Chop Dawg help with the hosting of an application upon completion?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>You bet. If you’ve decided to have your final product hosted on your own server, we will help you transfer the completed product to its new home. If you decide to remain hosted with us, we offer all clients complimentary hosting for as long as we can support you! This is a service offered to all active clients at no additional costs.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>Does Chop Dawg help with raising funding/capital?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Absolutely! We’ll offer our feedback on any presentation materials such as their pitch decks and business documents, and we will even help you write your pitch. We’re always happy to make introductions for you to angel investors and VC firms that are in our network. This is a service offered to all active clients at no additional costs.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>Does Chop Dawg help with attracting media attention?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>We do! We’ll offer our advice on how to stand out to the media when seeking to get coverage, and who to reach out to. We’ve also directly connected our clients with media partners in the past, such as Inc. Magazine, Entrepreneur Magazine, TechCrunch, TheNextWeb, Mashable, EliteDaily, NBC News, FOX News, ABC News, Startup Grind, Startups.co, Business Insider, and more. This type of consultation is always included for our active clients, at no additional cost.</p></div>

                        <div class="question transition"><p>Does Chop Dawg accept profit-sharing or equity as a form of payment?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Unfortunately, we do not. If you’re interested in learning more about why we (<em>and other high-quality development firms</em>) do not accept profit-sharing, equity, or joint-ventures as a form of compensation, <a href="https://chopdawg.com/stop-asking-companies-if-they-accept-equity/"><strong>you can read this post that our CEO Joshua Davidson wrote on the topic</strong></a>.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>How much will it cost to have Chop Dawg build my app?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Every project that we work on for our clients is different since no two apps or websites are ever the same! If you’re interested in learning more about this and why it is the case, <a href="http://chopdawg.com/how-much-would-it-cost-me-to-build-my-app-idea/"><strong>here is a thorough analysis on how much apps cost</strong></a>.</p>
        <p>Here are the broad ranges of project costs based on the platform. The time and labor a project takes to get built are big factors in where something falls in each range.</p>
        <p>Branding Projects: $1,000 to $10,000+ (<em>USD</em>)<br />
        WordPress/eCommerce Projects: $5,000 to $50,000+ (<em>USD</em>)<br />
        Non-Functional Prototype Projects: $10,000 to $30,000+ (<em>USD</em>)<br />
        User Interface Design Only Projects: $10,000 to $50,000+ (<em>USD</em>)<br />
        Programming Only Projects: $15,000 to $250,000+ (<em>USD</em>)<br />
        Website Application Projects: $25,000 to $250,000+ (<em>USD</em>)<br />
        iOS Application Projects: $15,000 to $250,000+ (<em>USD</em>)<br />
        Android Application Projects: $15,000 to $250,000+ (<em>USD</em>)</p>
        <p>If you’re interested in receiving a more exact quote estimate on your website or app idea, you can email us directly at <a href="mailto:Hello@ChopDawg.com"><strong>Hello@ChopDawg.com</strong></a>. We’d be more than happy to help you!</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>How does Chop Dawg’s billing structure work?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>When it comes to any project with us that will require over 40 hours of work, we bill at a set rate. You’ll know up front how much it will cost to build your new website, iPhone app, etc. with us.</p>
        <p>After we’ve worked together to establish the requirements of the project, our team will determine the scope of work required. We will provide you with an exact budget requirement, and a realistic estimate on the timeframe we expect your project to take. We do not believe in billing large projects by the hour, week, or month, to decrease potential inaccuracies in the final scope of work. This also keeps us in check, and it is in our best interest to keep projects timely and high-quality.</p>
        <p>When it comes to set-rate projects, smaller ones are usually broken into two payments with 50% due upfront, and 50% upon completion, ready for launch.</p>
        <p>For larger set-rate projects such as building an iPhone app, Android app, or web app, these projects are broken into multiple, equal payments for the duration of the project. For example, if you were quoted at $100,000 (<em>USD</em>) with an estimated timeframe of nine months of work with us, you would have a payment plan of ten payments of $10,000 (<em>USD</em>) throughout the entire project, owed monthly. The final payment would not be due until upon completion, ready for launch.</p>
        <p>If a project requested is under 40 hours of work, such as a small tweak/task, we would work with you to come up with a fair hourly rate. These type of projects we usually skip over the proposal process defined in Discovery, to help save and maximize time efficiency for our clients.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>How does Chop Dawg remain accountable for project delays?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>In the circumstances of a delay caused by us, we would push back a payment plan accordingly to the delay we have caused. For example, if we caused a 10-day delay due to us taking longer on wireframes for you, all future payment due dates will be pushed back by ten days to offset the difference.</p>
        <p>This is easily enforced since we agree upon the timed milestones before and during Discovery. It’s our expectation to always manage our clients fairly, and this is one of the ways we ensure we always hold ourselves accountable to do just that.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>How long does an average project with Chop Dawg take to complete?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>This answer in regards to project timeframes will vary by the type of project and client that we are working with. That said, here is a breakdown of the average time committed per project type with us over the last 24 months:</p>
        <p>Branding Projects: 1-2 Months<br />
        WordPress/eCommerce Projects: 2-3 Months<br />
        Non-Functional Prototype Projects: 2-3 Months<br />
        User Interface Design Only Projects: 2-3 Months<br />
        Programming Only Projects: 3-4 Months<br />
        Website Application Projects: 5-6 Months<br />
        iOS Application Projects: 6-7 Months<br />
        Android Application Projects: 7-8 Months</p>
        <p>When we provide the timeframe estimates above, this assumes that we are creating something from scratch. When starting at zero, you’ll need us to create the user interface design, backend programming, iOS/Android or web frontend programming, administrator backend, frontend website, branding, and server setup/configuration.</p>
        <p>During the project proposal stage, you’ll receive a breakdown of how long each phase will take and what is going to be done during the expected timeframes.</p>
        <p>If you’re interested in receiving a more exact timeframe estimate on your website or app idea, you can email us directly at <a href="mailto:Hello@ChopDawg.com"><strong>Hello@ChopDawg.com</strong></a>. We’d be more than happy to help you!</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>Does Chop Dawg set a limit to the amount of revisions/feedback during a project?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Nope, never. We never want you to feel you have sacrificed the quality of your product, ever. You’ll have the ability to provide us as much feedback and revisions through the Design phase on every single wireframe, high fidelity, and product flow provided to you. Only once you have approved each deliverable, we will move forward on the next phase of your project with us.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>How does Chop Dawg accept payments?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>We’re able to accept payments through three different methods. The most common way for our clients is ACH/Direct Deposit (<em>bank-to-bank</em>). We also accept checks to our mailing address, and credit/debit card through Plastiq or PayPal (<em>though this does add a 2.5% &#8211; 3.3% processing fee to each payment that you make</em>).</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>Does Chop Dawg provide references from active and previous clients?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Of course! Drop us an email at <a href="mailto:Hello@ChopDawg.com"><strong>Hello@ChopDawg.com</strong></a>, and we will be more than happy to direct you to our references. If you’re able to provide us with more details about what it is you’re trying to have built too, we can give you specific references matching that type of project to be the best fit.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>What does Chop Dawg program with for their websites and applications?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>For our websites and web applications, our method of choice when it comes to programming is PHP with MySQL. We use the framework Laravel when it comes to web application programming too. For most websites/eCommerce websites, you’ll traditionally find us working with WordPress and WooCommerce. We also support Magento and Bootstrap. All of our websites and web apps are written using HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
        <p>For our iOS applications, we support Swift and React Native. We also have the ability to support Objective-C for iOS, though we’ve been phasing this out to support Swift since it has been made the standard by Apple. When it comes to Android, we support Java and React Native. All of our iOS and Android applications use a REST API to communicate data.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>Will Chop Dawg sign my NDA?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>We unfortunately can&#8217;t sign your NDA since as an agency, businesses pitch us ideas that may be similar to yours. We can&#8217;t prevent ourselves from hearing other businesses&#8217; ideas or functionalities that may be similar in purpose. However, we don&#8217;t want businesses to ever think that we are stealing their ideas or not taking the protection of their intellectual property (IP) seriously. We offer our own bilateral NDA that makes sure that your idea is still protected between us and everything that you share is maintained with strict confidentiality. <strong><a href="https://chopdawg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Mutual-Nondisclosure-Agreement-ChopDawg.pdf">You can download our NDA here</a></strong>.</p></div>

                        <div class="question transition"><p>How many clients and projects has Chop Dawg worked with?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>We have worked with over 225+ companies and products to date.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>What makes Chop Dawg different?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>From the outset, we are doing something that many agencies do — build apps. You’ll find agencies that specialize in different technology stacks and verticals. We keep ourselves open because we can quickly expand our team to meet your needs. So, then, how do we differ?</p>
        <p>It’s in our philosophy of why we work in the first place. Our purpose is to help non-technical visionaries get a chance to release something game-changing. We exist to give companies and organizations that have fallen behind in technology the chance to get ahead.</p>
        <p>Most of all, we know all of the do’s and don’ts when it comes to building complicated apps. The core of our team has been around since the very beginning, so our smooth communication and process is something that you will notice quickly.</p>
        <p>Everyone in our team is united by the principles of customer service. We’re here for you, and we’ll only work with you if we believe in your idea as much as you do. We’re in it with you, and you’ll always walk away from a meeting knowing that we have your back.</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>Why the name “Chop Dawg”?</p></div>
                        <div class="answer"><p>Back in 2009, we couldn’t settle on the name Top Dawg or Chop Shop. We ended up compromising. The rest, as they say, was history!</p></div>
                        <div class="question transition"><p>What are the business hours and holidays recognized by Chop Dawg?</p></div>

        <p>Our company recognizes the following holidays and dates, and closes on: Memorial Day<em> (05/27/2019)</em>, Independence Day until the following Monday<em> (07/04/2019 &#8211; 07/08/2019)</em>, Labor Da<em>y (09/02/2019)</em>, Thanksgiving Eve through Black Friday <em>(11/27/2019 &#8211; 12/02/2019)</em>, and Christmas Eve until the first Monday of the following calendar year <em>(12/23/2019 &#8211; 01/06/2020)</em>.
